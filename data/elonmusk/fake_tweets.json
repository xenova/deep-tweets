The Tesla Semi is just a tiny bit faster! \"\n\nThe Tesla Semi is a super sexy concept car that Elon and Co. are working on. It could conceivably do for electric cars what the Matrix did for computers: revolutionise humanity.\n\nYou see, in the long term, climate change actually makes sense. If we reduce the rate of increase in greenhouse gases, the chances of avoidably dangerous events like a major hurricane or pandemic eventually becoming averted, then humanity has made a big mistake.\n\nUnfortunately, the human race is rapidly running out of time. Put simply, we are running out of space.\n\nTo make the case even more compelling, let's go all in and invest in a space mission to Mars. Invest in rockets, orbital rockets & spaceship. Let's put a man on the moon.\n\nBut even more important, let's make life as we know it multiplanetary as long as possible.\n\nThat's why we're creating a Mission to Mars party boat.\n\nSo we can actually get people to Mars.\n\nWe can't just show them how to build a house.\n\nAnd let's be real: no one wants to build a house in Mars's unforgiving climate\n\nSo instead, we invented this cool little robot. Doesn't speak a thing.\n\nLet me tell you about the future.\n\nHere it is: a house on Mars.\n\nAnd the only difference is that this one has wheels.\n\nSo what are your thoughts?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus",
